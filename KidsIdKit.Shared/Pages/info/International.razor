<h1>International Abductions</h1>
<p>If you believe that your child may be taken out of the country by their abductor, you will want to have these resources at the ready:</p>
<ol>
    <li>A court order that prohibits the child’s removal from the court’s jurisdiction.</li>
    <li>A list of phone numbers for the Airport Police at the airports where your child is most likely to be taken in order to leave the country.</li>
    <li>A list of the phone numbers for the Corporate Security Officers for the airlines that the other parent is most likely to use to leave the country.</li>
    <li>The numbers to the embassy offices where the other parent would most likely go to apply for a passport for your child.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your child is a U.S. Citizen under the age of 18, you can set up a Passport Issuance Alert to alert you if the abductor applies for a U.S. passport for your child.</p>

<p>Call the State Department at @phoneLink and request help.</p>
