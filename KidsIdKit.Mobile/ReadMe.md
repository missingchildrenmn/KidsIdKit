KidsIdKit.Mobile is a .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid app.

Even though the name suggests it's only for mobile devices, .NET MAUI allows it to run on both mobile and desktop platforms.

As a result, it could be renamed to something more comprehensive, such as:
	- KidsIdKit.MobileAndDesktop or
	- KidsIdKit.DesktopAndMobile
