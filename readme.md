This is a digital kids id kit app that allows parents to maintain a digital record of their kids' information. It is a simple app that allows parents to add their kids' information and provides helpful links to resources that parents can use to help keep their kids safe.

Original (legacy) code and lots of design details here: https://github.com/HTBox/MobileKidsIdApp

# Live Testing

The app is now available for testing via the browser. The actual deployment model will be as a native mobile app, but for testing purposes it is easier to allow people to use a web-based model.

* Run the [KidsIdKit](https://blue-wave-0c17dbf10.2.azurestaticapps.net/) web app

This is a PWA (progressive web app), which means you can ask your browser to install the app on your local device (phone, PC, etc.) and it will automatically update itself as we update the version published on the test server.
